Hey everyone!

I'm thrilled to announce the launch of my newly refreshed website. After a couple of hours of hard work (it's literally that fast with Astro) and dedication, the site now features a sleek design and a host of new content that I'm excited to share with you.

## What's New?

### Blog

I've added a blog section where I'll be posting regular updates on my projects, thoughts and maybe even tips and tricks I've learned along the way. Whether you're a fellow dev, a tech enthusiast, or just curious about what I'm up to, there's something here for you.

### Project List

The new project list showcases the various projects I've been working on. Each project includes a short description, technologies used, and links to the code repositories, if available. I hope this will give you a better insight into my work.

### Technologies Used

This website was built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is based on the [Astro Micro](https://github.com/trevortylerlee/astro-micro) theme and customised to my requirements.
