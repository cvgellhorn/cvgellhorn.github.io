After a lot of back and forth with wordpress and almost a year of no progress, I decided to move away from wordpress and build a simple website for our fun little side project.

## Why shiddy business ideas?

We've been working on a lot of different projects over the years and realized that a lot of the best ideas are actually quite simple. They also usually start out a bit shiddy, that's why we called it shiddy.biz.

## What's next?

We're going to keep adding more and more shiddy business ideas to the website and see where it goes.
