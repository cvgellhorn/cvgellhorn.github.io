## Crafting a Free Bento Grid Tool with AI Magic

Ever stared at a blank screen, trying to whip up a slick product marketing image, only to realize your design skills are stuck in the early 2000s? Yeah, me too. That’s why I decided to build a [free online tool](https://createbentogrid.com/) to create custom bento grid product marketing images—those tidy, visually tasty layouts that make your products pop. And here’s the kicker: I leaned hard on AI, specifically Cursor, to make it happen.

## What are bento grids?

Bento grids are all the rage for a reason. They’re clean, modular, and let you showcase multiple product angles or features in one glance. But coding a tool from scratch to generate them? That sounded like a headache. Enter Cursor, the AI-powered coding assistant that’s like having a patient, genius co-founder who never sleeps. I fed it my rough ideas—a drag-and-drop interface, customizable grid sizes, and a sprinkle of styling options—and watched it churn out clean, functional code faster than I could brew my morning coffee.

Now, the tool’s live and free for anyone to use. Upload your product shots, tweak the layout, and download a bento grid that’s ready to dazzle customers. No design degree required.

Try it out, and let me know if your marketing images start getting more likes than your vacation pics.
