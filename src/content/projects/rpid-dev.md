![rpid.dev Website](/images/projects/rpid-screen.jpeg)

I'm happy to announce that I launched [rpid.dev](https://rpid.dev/) today.
This will be an ongoing project where I'll be adding resources and tools that I use for rapid development.

**The goal is to be able to scaffold a project as quickly and efficiently as possible.**

## Where is this going?

I'm aiming to use this website as a personal resource for rapid development. I'll be adding more content and resources as I go along.
I also plan to make this website open source in the future, to allow contributions from the outside.
