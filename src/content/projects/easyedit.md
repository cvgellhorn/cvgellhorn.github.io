## Our first Shopify App
We just released our first Shopify app called EasyEdit - Order Editing. The app allows merchants to self serve order edits, such as updating the delivery address changing line items or cancelling an order altogether. 

It is currently available on the [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/easyedit-order-editing), there is also a 14 day free trial for anyone interested in trying out the capabilities.
